####Introduction to Frontend and Backend development
Frontend and Backend, in these days we hear those words very often, when it comes to building a technology product or technology-based product. Basically, when developers build a website, they divide their work into two parts, Front-End Development and Back-End Development.
The Front-End Development is a coding languages care about what a website looks like, specifically things like text, images, or video. All the style and layout we see on a website are what the frontend developer is working on. Moreover, all the elements you see on the client side, whether on a laptop or a mobile device, or whether on a browser or on an application. Basically, frontend applications are responsible on transfer the data between the client platforms and the server. In other words, frontend coding languages concern more about the presentation layers on the user screen.
Front-End Development also known as Client-Side Development, it mainly includes three coding languages, which are HTML, CSS, and Java Script. The combination of these three coding languages ensures that the user can easily read, write and interact with the website.

Now, in the other side, the Back-End Development. Simply, the backend development cares about how the website works. Thinks like, the data and the databases, how they deal and interact reciprocally with users, and of these, kind of abstractions, happened behind the scenes. For Instance when we click a button in the front end, it results actions, those actions based on series of processes, operations, or maybe procedures. Managing those processes is called Backend development.
Backend Developers have many options, in terms of coding languages, but usually to build a website, you need to pick just on language, unlike frontend development where you may combine more than one language in order to build your website surface. Examples of Backend development tools include PYTHON, JAVA, C++, PHP, RUBY and RAILS, etc.
