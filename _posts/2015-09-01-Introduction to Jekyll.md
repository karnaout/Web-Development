## What is Jekyll
Simply, Jekyll is a static site generator uses markdown or textile languages to build static websites from dynamic components. Jekyll is good choice to quickly spinning up a website and getting it online without much hassle or having to set too many things up, as long as you understand the structure of things and how they render together. However, Jekyll, as any other site builder, has some advantages and disadvantages.

## Advantages/Disadvantages

Jekyll is good start for any new web developer, or for anybody who wants a simple web page, for the following reasons:
   - Jekyll doesn't have any database therefore the website is a lot faster.
   - Because there is no database the site will be a lot more secure.
   - Jekyll very cheap way of maintaining a website and it's hoste for free on GitHub.
   - Jekyll is blog aware means you can write your content in markdown.
	
Disadvantages, using jekyll not for the appopriate purpose can cuase some troubles, those troubles can be a resualt of
   - No database, actually not having database is not always good. for users they can't sign in because actually there is nothing to sign in to.
   - No accounts, at the same token, not having database cause not being able to having any sort of account, unless you use some external plugs.
   - No responses, Jekyll is simple to a point where there isn't even any need to respond to a user, respond in terms of entering information form users, process them, and turn them out to results.
   - Since Jekyll is a command-line tool, Jekyll is not very friendly for those who are not familiar with using command line.

## Why would I use Jekyll over something like Wordpress
It's always great to have your website as fast as you can, when you use something like Wordpress for a small purposed website, you are actually not professionalize your work, because you let your server does tasks not necessarily needed. For instance, if you have a website on wordpress you have a template, the data base, and then you have the back end where we are actually editing and entering content. . These three things are abstracted from each other and that is really good if you maybe doing a lot of content editing overtime. But if your website intended to be as simple as possible, Jekyll help you to do that, it helps you to keep things lighter, and a little bit faster. Plus, it's really easy to get your website working on the server, just a few steps and the website is working!.
