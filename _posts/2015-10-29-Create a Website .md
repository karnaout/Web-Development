To start building any website you always have three choices or Development Tools.  
•	Hand-coded  
•	Website Builder  
•	Content Management systems [CMS]  
Those three tools give different types of possibilities for creating the website. Let’s start with hand-coded.

## Hand-coded:
Hand coded websites are developed brick by brick or code by code. As we know coding languages are special commands, abbreviations, and ways of arranging text. In many cases that requires a professional programmer and many hours of work. Even though, this tool can give you the best performance and hundred percent customizing, but professional programmers always try to cut off any extra work and they always try to do their work as least effort as they can.    

## Website Builder
Website builder is a very common tool to build a website. It’s a cheap way and extremely user-friendly with drag-and-drop features. It also doesn’t need any experience, knowledge in coding or databases for creating a usable website. There are however shortcomings such as limited sight speed luck of customization, and restricted Search Engine Optimization (SEO) options. Among the common use website builders are WIX, WEEBLY, JIMDO, YOLA, and MOONFRUIT.

## Content Management Systems [CMS]
In terms of Web-based content management, Content Management Systems (CMS) is usually defined as “server-side software that is designed to simplify the creation and maintenance of sites. These systems manage online content generate web pages, and allow users to upload and change content without requiring technical expertise.” 
We can think of CMS as a tool uses its internal framework or its essential supporting structure to help us building our website. Many Content Management Systems have pre-built templates and it allows you to add content, pages, or media …etc. 
Among the common use content management systems are WORDPRESS, JOOMLA, DRUPAL, MAGNETO, and VBULLETIN.
In the website we are building, I chose CMS as a tool, and WORDPRESS as a web software to create the website. I chose WORDPRESS because it’s free and very powerful. Actually WORDPRESS powered over 60 Million websites which is more than 17% of the web. Moreover, WORDPRESS is open source which allows us to modify and develop the website’s code easily and with no restrictions.
Now, to build the website using WORDPRESS, we open the host provider dashboard then we hit on Auto Installer, we choose WordPress. In just few minutes we will have the website installed and we will be set. After that all we need is to choose the template we want and start playing with the contents. By finishing those initial stages we would have a Website, so we can start coding out in order to customize the website in the way we want.
