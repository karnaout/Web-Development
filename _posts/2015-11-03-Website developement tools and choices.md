####Intro
Websites come in a variety of different shapes and sizes and they can be reached by using any of different tools. This is advantageous because you can find the tool that best fits your needs and the way you work. Last week discussion showed advantages and disadvantages of the three most common web development tools. Throughout this guide, I will shed light on the your choices in personal direction and compare them in order for you to find the best fits choice.    

Let us start with **Website buikders**. Website builders are usually cheap and user-friendly with a lot of features like (Drag and Drop). Also Website builders do not need for experience and knowledge in coding or databases to create the website. In contrast, there are some shortcomings like limited site speed and restricted choices for customization and SEO options. Among the common well-known used website builders are WIX, WEEBLY, JIMDO, YOLA and MOONFRUIT.    
**Hand-Coding** websites are developed brick  by brick  or code by code which will ensure the best customization, more control over the code that structures the website and better SEO (Search Engine Optimization) results. In terms of shortcomings, hand coded websites are expensive because their development applications usually costs a lot of money. In many cases that requires a professional programmer and many hours of work.    
**CMS**(content mangement systems), allows users to build professional web sites with no technical background. It is a cheap way and extremely user-friendly. It also does not need any experience, knowledge in coding or databases for creating a usable website. It promises of hIGH pERFORMANCE, high degree of customization and good SEO. Shortcomings are a lot but the most common ones are:  
* Modification requires knowledge of PHP  
* Graphics modification requires knowledge of CSS and HTML  
* The need to plenty of plugins to get the website installed  
* The script is not protected as well as other applications  
* Modifying tables or graphics format can be more complicated than in other applications  
* SQL Queries: queries can be complex since all additional non-standard fields that make WordPress, Joomal or drupal a CMS, require additional syntax.    
Now, let me summarize these information in this table. It is worth mentioning that Markdown does not provide any special syntax for tables. Instead it uses HTML Table syntax. But there exist Markdown syntax extensions which provide additional syntax for creating simple tables.

<p style="color:RED">Static vs. Dynamic Websites</p>
<h1 style="color:blue">Static vs. Dynamic Websites</h1>
An essential question here is static or dynamic website you need. Because the difference is not obvious when you’re just looking at a website in your browser, but it can make a big difference in the function of your website.  

**Static websites** are consist of a series of HTML files, each one representing a physical page of a website. So on static sites, each page is a separate HTML file. When you visit the homepage, you are viewing the actual homepage file. Where, a **dynamic website** uses server technologies (such as PHP) to dynamically build a webpage right when a user visits the page. The beggest difference between these two website types is the Dynamic Websites have database or we call it Back-End, in time Static websites don't have database at all. Look at this image

**So, Which website is best suitable for you?**  
There is no static answer to this question! You should decide it depending on your requirements and needs. However, the very simple answer for this question can be, if you need a website that doesn't have any sort of processing data or interacting with the users, in term of reading data, analyzing or make a response, your best choice is Static Website. But otherwise, Dynamic Websites are always better choice especially for big websites.
