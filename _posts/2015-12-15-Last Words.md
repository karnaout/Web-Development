<p>	This website contains findings, results and conclusions for an Independent Study made by Khaled Arnaout, for the course COMP-420 Independent Study, in fall 2015. Throughout this study, I have covered the following topics </p>
*	Creating a static website using Jekyll.
*	Host the website on Github
*	Jekyll Layouts, Markdown & Textile
*	Structuring and styling your pages with HTML and CSS
*	Differences between Markdown and HTML/CSS 
*	Web Fundamentals.
*	Creating a Website, The Three Development Tools 
*	Differences between Web Development Tools
*	Choosing a Web Development Tool
*	Frontend & Backend Development
*	Static vs Dynamic Website
*	Bootstrap  
Learning Web Development was my early goal. But in Monmouth College, the main focus, for Computer Science students, was on other fields of this science. I found a big chance to study this subject by myself and with the help of my supervisor, Professor James L. Mayfield, by taking this course.    
Before I make this study, I was totally ignorant about Web Development. I used to hear people saying terms like, Markdown, CSS, FTP, GitHub, frontend/backend Development or Bootstrap, I was a bit aware of the main concept of some of these terms, but that was not enough for me. I wanted to get myself more familiar and more comfortable to work with these web features.    
I, proudly, succeeded to do that. Now, I feel way more comfortable working with the stuff I have covered. I have more comprehensive idea about how the web works, the structure of a web page/ web site and the technologies involved in enhancing the design.
