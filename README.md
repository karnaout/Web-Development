## Reflections

Learning Web Development was my early goal. But in Monmouth College, the main focus, for Computer Science students, was on other fields and professions. I found a big chance to study this subject by myself and with the guidance of my supervisor, Professor James L. Mayfield, by taking this course. Before I make this study, I was totally ignorant about Web Development. I used to hear people saying terms like, Markdown, CSS, FTP, GitHub, frontend/backend Development or Bootstrap, but I didn't really understand the purpose and the difference between them. I was a bit aware of the main concept of some of these terms, but that was not my ambition. I wanted to get myself more familiar and more comfortable to work with these web features. I started this study by understanding the necessary concepts in web development. Then I built different Websites using different methods and serving different purposes. I also studied in more depth reasons make you choose a certain web development way or tool or another.I, proudly, succeeded to my goal. Now, I feel way more comfortable working with the stuff I learned. I feel that I gained a variety of teaching skills that will be helpful for me in my future.
